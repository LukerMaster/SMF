Smell Mah Fishy - A fish fighting game that was a successor to the project I made as my first programming project ever.

It's not very advanced, it was made purely to train C# coding as it turned out to be my first big C# project.

### Idea

Idea of this game started in 2014, when I wanted to create my first actual GAME. Any kind of game.
I thought of 2D fish-fightning game as it seemed to be an easy to create, fun to work with and silly project.

### Creation process

Original version of this game was written in C++ and SDL2. It was really bad, didn't have any GUI besides healthbar made out of

In 2019 I decided to revive this game as I had much more programming experience. But I didn't wanna go straight to Unity or UE4 for this.
I decided to use SFML and C# because I wanted to check if I'm capable of creating a game from somewhat-scratch. It worked.

### Gameplay

Everything is based on 1v1 fish fights with guns. You select your fish, your weapons and upgrades if needed, then you start the game and fight against an AI that is designed to be pretty... brutal. It is a little all over the place at this point, but everything works as an pre-alpha project.

### Features

- 9 different fishes to choose from.
- 3 different weapons to choose from.
- Adding fishes and weapons to the game is extremely easy. All you need is PNG file and XML file that is formed in very easy to understand way.
- Customizable game settings.
- Customizable fight settings.
- Fish ocassionally dying in the menu is a feature.
- Super difficult or super easy AI, depends on... It's a feature.
- Once I actually learn how to do proper AI it will be replaced by something that you certainly cannot win against.
- Adding music in is as easy as copying it into the folder (GitHub version is without music because copyrights).
